# What about Images?

The current tooling focuses on scanning containers, but you may want to
scan an image instead. However, an image is a container, albeit probably
one that's not running.

To scan an image we can write a simple script which boots an image and
then runs `lumogon` against the image instance. For example:

```
./scan-image.sh ocaml/opam
```

This script will pull the image (in this case `ocaml/opam`) and output to
stdout the Lumogon JSON output. Let's use JQ to find out the operating
system details of a third party image from Docker Hub:

```
$ ./scan-image.sh elasticsearch | jq ".containers[].capabilities.host.payload"
{
  "hostname": "55b3031db6b4",
  "kernelversion": "4.9.21-moby",
  "os": "linux",
  "platform": "debian",
  "platformfamily": "debian",
  "platformversion": "8.7",
  "procs": "61",
  "uptime": "263071",
  "virtualizationrole": "guest",
  "virtualizationsystem": "docker"
}
```

## Augmenting images with Lumogon

Another trick is to embed the data generated from Lumogon inside an
image. Here we:

* Pull the named image if it's not available locally
* Run an instance of the image
* Use Lumogon to conduct a scan
* Copy the scan output to the running container
* Save a new version of the image with the scan output on a new layer

```
./augment-image.sh <your/image>
```

This process has some interesting outcomes. For instance you can now access the
data from Lumogon directly via `docker run` or via `docker exec`. eg:

```
docker run --rm <your/image> cat /lumogon.json
```

Not only is this method faster than scanning an image or container repeatedly,
but if you're using immutable containers via the `--read-only` flag then you have
some guarantee the data has not been tampered with.

You'll find the code for these examples in the [Lumogon
repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon/tree/master/examples).
Both of these examples demonstrate how easy it is to build on top of
Lumogon and point the direction for the kinds of features we might add
into the tool at a later stage.
