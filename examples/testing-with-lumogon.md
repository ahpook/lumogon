# Testing with Lumogon

Given the ability to generate a data structure from a container or
image, a desirable use case for Lumogon is introducing tests to the image
build process, or building a constant-compliance style test suite for
production monitoring purposes. The following is a demonstration of how
simple this is building on top of Lumogon, more than it being a full
example. Depending on user feedback, and the interest in the open source
community, this would be a great area to explore and expand on.

Using less than 30 lines of Python we can create a framework to
write tests like the following. Because of how Lumogon uses data as a
first class interface itâ€™s simple to imagine writing similar tests
in other languages or testing frameworks too.

```python
from fixtures import lumogon

image_under_test = "debian"

def test_os(lumogon):
    family = lumogon['capabilities']['host']['payload']['platformfamily']
    assert "debian" == family

def test_systemd_present(lumogon):
    packages = lumogon['capabilities']['dpkg']['payload']
    assert "systemd" in packages

def test_label_present(lumogon):
    labels = lumogon['capabilities']['label']['payload']
    assert "com.docker.compose.service" in labels
```

You'll find the full working example in the
[Lumogon repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon/tree/master/examples).

The accompanying `Makefile` in the `examples/testing-with-lumogon`
directory should let you try this out. This requires Python and virtualenv
but otherwise you should just need to run:

```
make
```

Do try and write you're own assertions against the returned data, or
change the `image_under_test` to your own Docker image.

These tests could be used in a CI pipeline to verify that metadata was
set correctly, or that certain packages were installed, or that
known-vulnerable packages (across multiple different package managers or
operating systems) were not present, or that all images where using the
corporate standard operating system.
